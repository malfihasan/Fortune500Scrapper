# Fortune 500 Scrapper 
This is a project to scrapper the company information from the fortune.com ( Fortune 500 companies ) website, after getting the subscription. 

The project is originally inspired by this git :
https://github.com/kevinxperese/Fortune500

Due to some limitations in the above git, this project is an attempt to improve upon with same concept to have Fortune500 company data. 

**Important Notes:** To use the git you probably need to have a month's trial subscription from Fortune Magazine costing $1.
Fortune magazine has its own data service. This project is for a basic information scrapping attempt, but if you need more detailed data, 
it is advised to use the Fortune.com subscription itself. This project is only for personal use.
